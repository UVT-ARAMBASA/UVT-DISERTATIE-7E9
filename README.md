# Mandelbrot-DMD: Learning Fractal Structures with Autoencoders and Dynamic Mode Decomposition  

This project explores **nonlinear dynamical systems** using **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Autoencoders**. It approximates the **Mandelbrot set** by learning the evolution of complex iterative systems.  

## ðŸ“¦ Installation  

To set up the project, install the required dependencies using:  

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install for you all the required packages/imports.

```
**Research and Methods**:

This project builds on state-of-the-art methods:

DMD for spectral analysis of complex systems
Autoencoders for latent space compression
Parametric and recurrent models for learning long-term behavior

The models are based on works such as:

Alford-Lago et al. (2022) - Deep Learning Enhanced DMD
Korda & MeziÄ‡ (2018) - Koopman-Based Model Predictive Control
Otto & Rowley (2019) - Linearly-Recurrent Autoencoder

**Future Work**
1. More structured workflow
2. Improved Visualisation
3. Pretrained models for faster testing if necessary
