# Mandelbrot-DMD: Learning Fractal Structures with Autoencoders and Dynamic Mode Decomposition  

This project explores **nonlinear dynamical systems** using **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Autoencoders**. It approximates the **Mandelbrot set** by learning the evolution of complex iterative systems.  

## ðŸ“¦ Installation  

To set up the project, install the required dependencies using:  

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install for you all the required packages/imports which are themselves contained in the requirements.txt file.

```
**Datasets**
The dataset consists of input-output pairs. These pairs represent the solutions of the nonlinear dynamical system and their corresponding classification within the Mandelbrot set. The input data consists of the iterative solutions of the system defined as:
\[
z_{n+1} = (A z_n)^2 + c
\]

where:
- \( z_n \in \mathbb{C}^d \) (a complex vector in \( d \)-dimensions),
- \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} \) (a real-valued matrix),
- \( c \in \mathbb{C} \) (a complex parameter).

The system evolves over a predefined number of iterations while tracking the behavior of \( z_n \) for various sampled values of \( c \).

## **Mathematical Formulation**
This iterative system generalizes the well-known Mandelbrot and Julia sets to higher dimensions using a transformation matrix \( A \). The evolution of \( z_n \) depends on:
- The choice of \( A \) (which may introduce stretching, rotation, or other transformations).
- The complex parameter \( c \).
- The initial condition \( z_0 \).

**Research and Methods**:

This project builds on state-of-the-art methods:

DMD for spectral analysis of complex systems
Autoencoders for latent space compression
Parametric and recurrent models for learning long-term behavior

The models are based on works such as:

Alford-Lago et al. (2022) - Deep Learning Enhanced DMD
Korda & MeziÄ‡ (2018) - Koopman-Based Model Predictive Control
Otto & Rowley (2019) - Linearly-Recurrent Autoencoder

**Future Work**
1. More structured workflow
2. Improved Visualisation
3. Pretrained models for faster testing if necessary
